# Jest Testing with The Odin Project

### Assignment
Write tests for the following, and then make the tests pass!

1. A `capitalize` function that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized.

2. A `reverseString` function that takes a string and returns it reversed.

3. A `calculator` object that contains functions for the basic operations: add, subtract, divide, and multiply. Each of these functions should take two numbers and return the correct calculation.

4. A `caesarCipher` function that takes a string and a shift factor and returns it with each character shifted. Read more about how a Caesar cipher works.
  * Donâ€™t forget to test wrapping from z to a. For example, `caesarCipher('xyz', 3)` should return `'abc'`.
  * Donâ€™t forget to test case preservation. The shifted letter-case should follow the original letter-case. For example, `caesarCipher('HeLLo', 3)` should return `'KhOOr'`.
  * Donâ€™t forget to test punctuation. Punctuations, spaces, and other non-alphabetical characters should remain unchanged. For example, `caesarCipher('Hello, World!', 3)` should return `'Khoor, Zruog!'`.
  * For this one, you may want to split the final function into a few smaller functions. One concept of Testing is that you donâ€™t need to explicitly test every function you write (just the public ones). So in this case you only need tests for the final `caesarCipher` function. If it works as expected you can rest assured that your smaller helper functions are doing what theyâ€™re supposed to.

5. An `analyzeArray` function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with the following properties: average, min, max, and length. For example:

```javascript
const object = analyzeArray([1,8,3,4,2,6]);

object == {
   average: 4,
   min: 1,
   max: 8,
   length: 6
};
```
