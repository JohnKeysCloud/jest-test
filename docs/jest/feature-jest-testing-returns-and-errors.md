## Testing Functions for Return Values and Errors in Jest

In the context of JavaScript and testing with Jest, when we say a function "throws an error," it means the function does not return a value in the normal way but instead interrupts its execution and "throws" an error object. This is different from a function returning a value (such as a string or number).

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

- **Returning a value**: The function completes its execution and gives back a result.
- **Throwing an error**: The function execution stops, and an error is thrown. This error can be caught by an error-handling mechanism (try/catch) or, in testing, by Jest's `expect().toThrow()`.

In Jest, to test if a function throws an error, you need to pass a function to `expect()`, not the result of the function call. This is because Jest needs to execute the function inside its `expect` block to catch the error being thrown.

Here is the correct usage:

1. **Testing a return value**:

    ```javascript
    test('an empty string should return an empty string', () => {
      expect(TOPTestingAssignments.capitalizeFirstLetter('')).toBe('');
    });
    ```

    Here, you are checking that calling `capitalizeFirstLetter('')` returns an empty string. 

2. **Testing if a function throws an error**:

    ```javascript
    test('should throw an error for non-string inputs', () => {
      expect(() => TOPTestingAssignments.capitalizeFirstLetter(123)).toThrow(TypeError);
      expect(() => TOPTestingAssignments.capitalizeFirstLetter({})).toThrow(TypeError);
      expect(() => TOPTestingAssignments.capitalizeFirstLetter([])).toThrow(TypeError);
    });
    ```

    Here, you are testing that calling `capitalizeFirstLetter` with a non-string argument throws a `TypeError`. The arrow function `() => TOPTestingAssignments.capitalizeFirstLetter(123)` is necessary because it delays the execution of `capitalizeFirstLetter` until `expect` handles it.

So, the error is not a return value in the traditional sense but an interruption in the normal flow of execution that Jest can check for using `expect().toThrow()`.
